# CIS11 – Team DJ – Test-Score-Calculator
LC-3 CIS-11 Test Score Calculator
# LC-3 Test Score Calculator

A comprehensive assembly language program for the LC-3 computer architecture that processes test scores and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and stack data structure implementation.

## Project Overview

This project implements a test score management system that:
- Accepts 5 test scores from user input
- Displays letter grades for each score
- Calculates and displays statistical information (minimum, maximum, average)
- Demonstrates stack operations by finding the lowest grade using PUSH/POP operations

## Team Members

- **Daniel Rios**
- **Jade Thong**

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Input**: Prompts user for 5 two-digit test scores (0-99)
- **Grade Conversion**: Converts numeric scores to letter grades using standard grading scale
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates minimum, maximum, and average scores
- **Stack Operations**: Demonstrates PUSH/POP functionality to find lowest grade

### Grading Scale
| Score Range | Letter Grade |
|-------------|--------------|
| 90-100      | A            |
| 80-89       | B            |
| 70-79       | C            |
| 60-69       | D            |
| 0-59        | F            |


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- LC-3 Simulator (such as LC-3 Edit or similar LC-3 development environment)
- Basic understanding of assembly language concepts

### Installation & Execution

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/danieljrios/CIS11---TDJ---Test-Score-Calculator]
```

2. **Load the program**
   - Open your LC-3 simulator
   - Load the `test_score_calculator.asm` file
   - Assemble the program

3. **Run the program**
   - Set the program counter to x3000
   - Execute the program
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to enter test scores
